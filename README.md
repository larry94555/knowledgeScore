# knowledgeScore
An open source project to provide a transparent score of a sound bite

An ideal knowledge system would enable one to score a sound bite in terms of reliability, bias, emotional tone, and clarity.  This same system should be transparent in its evaluation and should upon this review, establish trust.

Is this possible?  Probably not.  Still, it would be interesting to see how close it is possible to go to this ideal.

Here's the problems that need to be solved:
How to make the calculation of each score?
How to make the calculation transparent?
How to establish trust with the transparency of the calculation?
For purposes of this effort, I will create an open source project in python.
